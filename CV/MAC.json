      "description": "From my initial training in Art Direction to my transition into programming, my career has been a journey of continuous learning and adaptation. A passion for technology led me to study for a higher degree in Systems Administration and then into web and mobile development. With experience in technical support and Front-End, my career took a decisive turn towards full-stack web development after completing the Ironhack Bootcamp in 2020.\nCurrently, I work as a Front-end Developer at Housell. I apply my skills in HTML, SASS, Javascript, and PHP for website development and Angular, Typescript, and Ionic for app development. My approach is straightforward: find solutions, keep learning, and enhance teamwork.\n\nKey Achievements\n* Built and enhanced over 50 websites and mobile apps, significantly improving responsiveness and user interaction.\n* Managed web app migration from Cordova to Capacitor, improving performance and scalability.\n* Actively improved user experience across several projects.\n* Reduced the crash rate in the Housell app from a high percentage of errors to less than 1%. This achievement reflects an improvement in app stability and user satisfaction based on performance metrics in the Google Play Store.\n\nFun Facts\nI have been a plangonologist for over 20 years. If you're curious about what that means, feel free to contact me at c.elizabeth.gorosito@gmail.com\n\nSkills\n* Development: HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript, PHP, Typescript, React, Angular, Ionic, Node.js\n* Tools: Git, Docker, Jira\n* Methodologies: Agile, Scrum",

Lo que me motiva día a día es la posibilidad de enfrentar nuevos retos, resolver problemas complejos y contribuir al crecimiento y mejora de los proyectos en los que trabajo.\nEn el apartado de \"¿cuál sería el trabajo super ideal?\" me encantaría que mi próximo desafío laboral estuviera parcialmente vinculado con la IA generativa. He hecho una certificación en la Universidad de Helsinki y me parece fascinante. Me encantaría poder adquirí más conocimientos en ese campo :)\n"
